# Recipes Website
*This idea came from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).*

This will be a basic recipe website for the purpose of practicing HTML. Upon completion, I will have put into practice the basic concepts of HTML including links, images, lists, headers, paragraphs, text formatting, and security best practices. This will demonstrate my understanding of the foundations of HTML.
